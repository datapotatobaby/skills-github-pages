# Github Pages and Jekyll for Blogging
I'm testing Jekyll as a blogging framework, and as a component of Github Pages. I have been using Github pages for my own professsional site, and it works fine for a static site.
One thing I'm curious about is, does Jekyll handle automatic line breaks? Do I have to type my text in an akward or specific way, within the github text editor? We shall see.

I can see already that I would probably be using a folder within Obsidian as my `__posts/` source for my blog, and pushing it to github every time a have a new blog post completed.
I do like the idea of having a markdown blog. And wthin that markdown blog, I can test/use Obsidian's document linking for internal links within my own published journal and knowledge base.

Off to the races!
